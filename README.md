# Twitter Sentiment Using Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services

Some basic steps I used to gather Twitter sentiment natural language processing:

* Sign up for a Microsoft Azure account, they have alot of free options when first signing up, you will want to use their Cognitive Services
* You will need to get a [Twitter Developer Account] (https://developer.twitter.com/), then sign up for "Elevated" access.
